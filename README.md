# VISION
Vision is an iOS app that helps people discover their creative spark, by collecting their thoughts and generating inspiring visual artwork through the power of generative AI.
## Generate Inspiration
Our app is connected via API to ChatGPT for input analysis and to Dall-E for image generation based on the analysis of the user-provided prompts.

To run:
- Create an account and app with Firebase enabling the Realtime Database, Email Authentication and Storage features. Ensure read/write security rules are updated and download the GoogleServices.plist file and save it in the project.
- Navigate to OpenAI's website and generate a new API key for use with the app. Create a local Config.plist file in the project and save your API key here with the reference as "GPT".
- Build the project with dependencies and enjoy!
